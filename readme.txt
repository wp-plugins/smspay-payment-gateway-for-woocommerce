A mobile friendly payment solution for WooCommerce -trigger payment via SMS!

== Description ==

SMSpay Payment Gateway for WooCommerce allows you to accept payments via SMS on WooCommerce, using the SMSpay.io service.

You can receive payments in two ways:
- Via operator
- VISA/Mastercard

All the user needs, is to send an SMS. It's that easy.

The checkout is the same as a normal checkout, with the advantage of faster and easier payements, driving more conversions.

It's free to get started; you only pay per transaction (SMS payments only).

NOTE: You can also use SMSpay for offline transactions and donations outside of WooCommerce.

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Click the menu item WooCommerce => Settings => Checkout => SMSpay
1. Click the link to sign up (it's free!)
1. Enter fields, and click to activate before hitting Save. That's it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is SMSpay a good fit for my shop? =
SMSpay is excellent for:

- Memberships and subscriptions
- Virtual products
- Books and magazines
- Events
- Basically: products cheaper than 500 NOK

You can however use SMSpay for all kinds of products and prices, by enabling the card option. A monthly fee is needed for this.

The card option let's you store the user's VISA, and trigger payment from that card via SMS later.

= When is SMSpay a bad fit =
- For products costing more than 500 NOK
- Electronics and jewellery

Again: use the card option if these limitations are bad for you.

= What are the prices? =
- Signup fee: FREE
- Monthly fee: FREE
- Transaction: In Norway, the standard fee per transaction is 6% + 3 NOK

= How do I know the exact payout amount? =
See the report in admin.smspay.io
